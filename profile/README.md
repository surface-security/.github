The Surface Security project is an open source initivate to provide a working security intelligence and automation platform that empowers individuals and engineering teams to create an inventory of a company's assets, as well as bring visibility over said assets and their relationships with the many data points Surface collects.

This org houses all code repositories for the apps and modules that have been and will be open sourced throughout time.
